You are helping me design an engaging, time‑efficient single NotebookLM notebook to celebrate Swami Vivekananda Jayanti (12 January, National Youth Day in India).

Within this one notebook, propose 8–10 concrete ‘sections’ or ‘use‑cases’ (e.g., youth-focused reflection guide, speech‑prep assistant, quote explorer, quiz generator), each described in 2–3 sentences and tailored for NotebookLM’s features (sources, notes, guides, podcasts, mind maps, flashcards).

For each section, give step‑by‑step implementation inside the same notebook: what documents or links to upload, how to organise sources and notes, which NotebookLM tools to use (summaries, flashcards, quizzes, overviews), and example custom instructions/prompts.

Include at least 3 sections that require customisation (custom instructions, role prompts, or specific workflows) and clearly label what to customise and why it improves learning or engagement.

For every section, estimate effort in three buckets: (a) researching/finding materials, (b) preparing or supplying documents, and (c) in‑NotebookLM work.

Prioritise sections that can be completed within 1–2 focused sessions (under 2–3 hours each) and explicitly indicate which ones are ‘quick wins’.

Present the answer as:

A short table listing all sections with columns: ‘Section name’, ‘Goal’, ‘Needs customisation? (Y/N)’, ‘Overall effort level’, ‘Quick win? (Y/N)’.

Then a section for each idea with numbered implementation steps and copy‑paste‑ready sample prompts/instructions optimised for use inside a single NotebookLM notebook.
