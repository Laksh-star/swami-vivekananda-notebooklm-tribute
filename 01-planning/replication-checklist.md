## Adaptation Ideas

This framework works for:

| Subject Type | Example | Key Adjustments |
|--------------|---------|-----------------|
| **Historical figures** | Gandhi, Tagore, MLK, Mandela | Focus on speeches, biography, legacy |
| **Thought leaders** | Modern authors, philosophers | Include book summaries, interviews |
| **Academic content** | Course materials, textbook chapters | Heavy on Q&A, study guides |
| **Organizational knowledge** | Company history, founder wisdom | Internal docs, meeting notes, values |
| **Family wisdom** | Grandparent stories, family history | Oral history transcripts, letters |

---

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Outputs feel generic | Improve source quality; add more specific quotes |
| Audio sounds robotic | Regenerate with custom prompt for conversational tone |
| Mind map too cluttered | Ask for simplified version with fewer branches |
| Chat doesn't cite sources | Check that sources are properly indexed |
| Flashcards too easy | Regenerate with "challenging, exam-level" in prompt |

*You're not just building a notebook—you're creating a living knowledge ecosystem. Take your time with the sources; everything else flows from there.*
