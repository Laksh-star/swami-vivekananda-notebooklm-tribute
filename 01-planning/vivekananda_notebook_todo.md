## Notes Section

### What to Do If...

- **Phase 1 takes longer:** The Perplexity prompts sometimes need refinement. If the output looks generic, add: "Format this as a professional study guide with clear sections and citations."  
- **NotebookLM indexing is slow:** This is normal. Wait the full 3 minutes before moving to Task 2.4.  
- **Audio quality sounds robotic:** Use Task 4.3 chat prompt to regenerate with: "Make this sound more conversational and warm, like a mentor speaking."  
- **Mind Map looks cluttered:** Use a follow-up chat: "Simplify this mind map. Show only 5 major branches with 2 sub-ideas each."

### Success Indicators

- ✅ Phase 1: All 7 PDFs are named and organized  
- ✅ Phase 2: Notebook shows all sources in the sidebar  
- ✅ Phase 3: Audio plays smoothly; mind map is visual and clear  
- ✅ Phase 4: Chat prompts generate unique, relevant content  
- ✅ Phase 5: Three pinned templates appear when anyone opens the notebook
